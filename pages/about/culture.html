            <b>Nizami Culture:</b>Hyderabad's Nizam culture boasts a rich and
            illustrious heritage from the era of the Nizams, who ruled the
            princely state for centuries. Embracing a fusion of Indo-Islamic and
            European architectural styles, the city showcases remarkable palaces
            such as the Chowmohallah Palace and Falaknuma Palace, reflecting
            their penchant for opulence and refinement. Nizam's patronage of
            arts and crafts led to the flourishing of Bidriware and Kalamkari
            crafts, and their love for literature and poetry nurtured a rich
            literary tradition in Urdu. Known for their extravagant lifestyle
            and association with pearls and diamonds, Hyderabad earned the
            moniker "City of Pearls." Even today, Hyderabad cherishes its Nizami
            heritage through cultural celebrations and events, preserving the
            legacy of a bygone era marked by graciousness and sophistication.

            <b>Languages:</b> Hyderabad, the capital city of the Indian state of
            Telangana, is a melting pot of languages and linguistic diversity.
            The city's linguistic landscape is a reflection of its rich
            historical and cultural heritage. Telugu and Urdu are the two
            primary languages spoken in Hyderabad. Telugu, being the official
            language of Telangana, is widely spoken by the native population. It
            holds a special place in the hearts of the people, and many cultural
            events, literature, and traditional art forms are deeply rooted in
            the Telugu language. Urdu, on the other hand, carries a historical
            significance due to Hyderabad's association with the Nizams, who
            ruled the princely state for several centuries. The influence of the
            Nizami culture and their love for Urdu poetry and literature has
            left a lasting impact on the city. Even today, Urdu is spoken and
            cherished by many residents, especially in the older parts of the
            city. Apart from Telugu and Urdu, Hyderabad is a linguistic hub,
            welcoming people from various regions and backgrounds. It is not
            uncommon to hear other Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi,
            Kannada, and Bengali being spoken in different pockets of the city.
